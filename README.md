# Cursee: Summons

> template derived from [https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template)

*Summons* was created for the **Minecraft Modding Madness Modjam** hosted by [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/) during September 2024.

### Details
*Summons* is centered around new creature companions which will aid you on your journeys through the Overworld, Nether, 
and End dimensions found in Minecraft. To begin with the mod, players must locate a Summoning Nexus and begin a ritual 
to summon unique and powerful allies from the **Void**.

Your summoned creatures will respect you and fight for you always... until you disrespect them. Be careful to keep them
within your grasps, as their connection to your soul gives them ample power over you if they turn against you...
